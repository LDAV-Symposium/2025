# LDAV 2025 - Large Data Analysis & Visualization

Modern large-scale scientific simulations, sensor networks, and experiments are
generating enormous datasets, with some projects approaching the multiple
exabyte range in the near term. Managing and analyzing large datasets in order
to transform it into insight is critical for a variety of disciplines including
climate science, nuclear physics, security, materials design, transportation,
and urban planning. The tools and approaches needed to mine, analyze, and
visualize data at extreme scales can be fully realized only if there are
end-to-end solutions, which demands collective, interdisciplinary efforts.

The 15th IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium, to be held in conjunction with IEEE VIS 2025, is specifically targeting methodological innovation, algorithmic foundations, and possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV symposium will bring together domain scientists, data analysts, visualization researchers, and users to foster common ground for solving both near- and long-term problems. Paper submissions are solicited for long and short paper tracks. Topic emphasis is on algorithms, languages, systems, and/or hardware solutions that support the collection, analysis, manipulation, or visualization of large-scale data. See the LDAV website for topic details and for details on the “large data” emphasis.

We hope to see you there! 

To attend LDAV, please register through the [IEEE VIS website](http://ieeevis.org).
